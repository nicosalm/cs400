    <h1>Bogosort – The Underrated Champion of Sorting Algorithms</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! You may wonder what planet you are on. You may wonder why you are
      here. You may wonder why you are reading this. All of this is irrelevant.
      What is relevant is that you are here to learn about the greatest sorting
      algorithm of all time: Bogosort.

      <br />
      <br />

      Bogosort is a sorting algorithm that is so bad that it is actually good.
      <em>How?</em>
    </p>

    <h2>How to use Bogosort</h2>
    <p>
      To use Bogosort, you must first have an array of numbers. Then, you must
      shuffle the array until it is sorted. If you are lucky, it will be sorted
      in the first shuffle. If you are unlucky, it will take a long time. But,
      if you are really unlucky, it will never be sorted. This is why it is so
      good.

      <ol>
        <li>Shuffle the array.</li>
        <li>Check if the array is sorted.</li>
        <li>If the array is sorted, stop. If not, go to step 1.</li>
        <li>Profit.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Why Bogosort is so good</h2>
    <p>
      Why, you may ask, is Bogosort so good? Well, it is so good because it is so. All you need to
      do is glance at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Wikipedia</a> page. It
      tells you all you need to know.
